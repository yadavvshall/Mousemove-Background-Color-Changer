Interactive Mousemove Background Color Changer
A simple JavaScript application that changes the background color of an element based on mouse movement within it. It uses the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) for smooth transitions.


Features
Interactive Background Color Change: The application responds to mouse movements within the element and smoothly changes the background color based on the mouse's position.
Customizable Colors: You can easily customize the colors used for the background based on your preferences.
Easing Function: The application uses a "power4" easing function from GSAP to create smooth and visually pleasing transitions.
Reset on Mouse Leave: The background color resets to white when the mouse leaves the element.
